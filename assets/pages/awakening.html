                                        <p>Link's Awakening began as a port of the Super NES game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, developed after-hours by Nintendo staff. It grew into an original project under the direction of Takashi Tezuka, with a story and script created by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kensuke Tanabe. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is the fourth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series, and the only Zelda title on the original Game Boy. A color update, titled Link's Awakening DX, is one of the three Zelda titles for the Game Boy Color. Since its release, Link's Awakening has been popular among fans and critics. By 2004, the original release had sold 3.83 million copies worldwide, while Link's Awakening DX sold 2.22 million. In 2009, Guinness World Records named it the 42nd most influential video game of all time</p>

                                        <p>Link, who had defeated the evil Ganon and regained peace in Hyrule, had not enjoyed the tranquility he had worked so hard to achieve for long, and eventually became restless. Feeling in need of training or enlightenment, he embarked on a journey and sailed across the oceans in a small sailboat. Eventually, Link completed his training in foreign countries and began to sail back to his home, Hyrule. But suddenly the seas turned rough and the skies became dark. Link tried valiantly to fight the strong currents of the waves, even tying himself to the ship with some rope. But a bolt of lightning struck the ship and everything went dark.
                                        Link washed up on the Shores of Koholint Island  
                                                Later on a faraway Island, a young girl named Marin is walking along the Shores of the Island's beach. She suddenly spots someone laying on the sands. Upon looking closer, she finds an unconscious Link and tries to wake him, but to no avail. Unwilling to simply leave him lying on the beach, Marin takes Link back to her house in Mabe Village. From beyond the darkness, Link hears the voice of a girl. He first mistakes the voice to be that of Princess Zelda, but wakes up to discover that it was instead the voice of Marin It turned out that, miraculously, Link had been washed ashore on Koholint Island. Link starts his preparations to leave Koholint Island, and Tarin gives him back his Shield. He also tells him of another thing that washed up on the beach. </p>
